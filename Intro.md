Good morning, I’m Suhas Jadhav. I’m currently pursuing my B.E. in Information Technology from D. Y. Patil College of Engineering, Akurdi, with the CGPA of 8.05.

I am a full-stack developer with a strong foundation in Python, Java, SQL, and core computer science concepts. I enjoy working across the stack—from designing clean APIs and managing databases to building responsive user interfaces.

I’ve worked on a Python-based object detection project using the YOLO model, where I built a basic car-detection pipeline. I’ve also developed a real-time chat application using Socket.IO and WebRTC, as well as an AI-driven digital twin with secure authentication and optimized API routes. These projects strengthened my understanding of data handling and backend optimization.

I’m comfortable working with SQL queries in real application scenarios. I focus on logic, problem-solving, and writing clean code, and I’ve solved over 250 DSA problems in Java, which helps me approach problems systematically.

Apart from academics, last year I served as the Sports Co-Secretary on our campus. In my free time, I enjoy running and drawing.
